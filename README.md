# Hi there! 👋

I'm Tegar, a **Computer Science** student based in Indonesia. 


I design and build whatever sparks my curiosity.


I am passionate about AI and building real-world solutions.


Currently, I'm falling down the audio processing rabbit hole—shoutout to the YouTube wizards helping me figure out background noise removal, speaker diarization, and music classification.


My main tech stack is **Python**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **Scikit-learn**. My favorite tools are **VSCode**and **GitHub**


**Note:** Btw, my profile pict comes from the manhwa *"[Everyone Loves Her](https://myanimelist.net/manga/180338/Everyone_Loves_Her)"* If it caught your eye, check it out!—stunning art and a story worth feeling.


Thank you for visiting!
